### 🚀 About The Project

In an era of uncertainty, the human cortex struggles to process the linear progression of the Gregorian calendar. We asked ourselves: *Is there a way to use billions of transistor gates to calculate exactly what comes after today?*

After minutes of intense R&D, we created **whatdayisit**.

Using a proprietary algorithm known as `CurrentTime + 24 Hours`, our Artificial Intuition (AI) analyzes the rotation of the Earth to deliver a prediction of tomorrow's day with **near 100% accuracy**.*

### ✨ Key Features

* **Deep Learning? No.** We use **Deep Looking** at the system clock.
* **Zero-Latency Predictions:** Knowing the future has never been this instant.
* **Minimalist UI:** We removed all distractions so you can focus on the word "Thursday."
* **Eco-Friendly:** Consumes slightly less energy than a Bitcoin mining rig.

### 🛠️ Installation

To harness this power on your local machine, you will need Node.js and a sense of humor.

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/whatdayisit.git](https://github.com/yourusername/whatdayisit.git)](https://github.com/CheesePandesal/tomorrow-predictor.git)
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies** (Downloading the heavy math libraries)
    ```bash
    cd tomorrow-predictor
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Ignite the Artificial Intuition**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your future.

### 🧮 How It Works

While our source code is open, the logic is proprietary. However, here is a simplified representation of the complex math happening in the background:

$$Day_{tomorrow} = Day_{today} + 1$$

### 🤝 Contributing

If you discover a bug where Tuesday is followed by Thursday, please open a high-priority issue immediately as this indicates a rift in the space-time continuum.
